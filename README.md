# Buzzfeed Quiz Clone

This is a new project trying to recreate **Buzzfeed** type pop quizzes with the help of react

Since I am using react for the first time, it was advised by many developers to not use *`Redux`* as it can complicate the app and be responsible
for a whole new mess.

So instead, I used **`useContext`** hook and it has made things easier for me. Instead of lifting up state or prop drilling, I can pass the state to my required components and be happy with the result.

I will try my very best to update this **ReadME** every time I commit to the branch with date and time, as it can be seen as a journal of a newbie in this exciting world of ***React***

## Have a wonderful time!
